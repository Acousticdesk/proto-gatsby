      <p>
        My name is Andrii and I like playing music, traveling, talking to my frields,
        sport and many other things!
        Except all that I like sharing the knowledge I find useful.
        Knowledge that lets you make your development process easier and more fun!
      </p>

    <div className="content__section">
      <h5 className="content__header">С чего все началось?</h5>

      <p>
        I work as a developer for 4 years! During this time I’ve found it necessary
        to find and research relevant information on the topic.
      </p>
      <p>
        It takes some time to find the information on
        “how to make a development process better and easier”.
      </p>
      <p>
        Letconst is a great place where I can share
        all the research with my mates developers every day!
